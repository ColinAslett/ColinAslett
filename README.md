### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github page which contains all of my personal projects. I recommend checking out WeatherApp and CollegeFootballRATINGSystem projects in the repository section of my page.


I primarily code in Java but have several years of experience with C++ and Python, I also have about a years experience in R,SML, and HTML.
